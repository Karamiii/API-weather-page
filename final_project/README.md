Final project documentation.

05.04.2022:
Started the project.
Got done with the navigation bar and fetching the data and displaying it. 
There is an issue with displaying the data on tuni homepages. (fixed (Had to change the "http" adress to "https"))

07.04.2022:
Trying to create a chart for wind speed, but its dont displaying data correctly. (Fixed)

08.04.2022:
Added selector to choose the timespan of displayed data. 
There is an issue with the collector data. The data stack on top of eachother and wont refresh the collector data.
Not really a big problem, more like an inconvenience

 (not fixed( Might have to turn to Louis on this one))

 10.04.2022:
 Added 2 electors to main page to choose timespan and value which to inspect. Got it working but it all seems a bit slow? Might be the data stacking issue that slows the page.
