07.04.2022:
- Trying to create a chart for wind speed, but its dont displaying data correctly. (Fixed)

08.04.2022:
- Added selector to choose the timespan of displayed data. 
- There is an issue with the collector data. The data stack on top of eachother and wont refresh the collector data.
 (fixed (Thnx Louis))

10.04.2022:
- Added 2 electors to main page to choose timespan and value which to inspect. Got it working but it all seems a bit slow? Might be the data stacking issue that slows the page.
